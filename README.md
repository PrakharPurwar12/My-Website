Portfolio Website

This repository contains my personal portfolio website, designed to present my academic background, technical skills, and project experience in data science and full stack development. The portfolio focuses on clean design, responsiveness, and clarity while highlighting data-driven and software-oriented projects.

Overview

The portfolio provides a consolidated professional profile including personal introduction, education, projects, skills, certifications, and contact information. It is intended to give recruiters and collaborators a clear understanding of my technical capabilities and career direction.

Tech Stack

The website is built using HTML for structure and content, Tailwind CSS for responsive and modern styling, and basic JavaScript for interactivity. Git and GitHub are used for version control and deployment.

Features

The portfolio includes a responsive layout suitable for different screen sizes, a clean and professional user interface, a structured project showcase, a comprehensive skills section covering data science and full stack technologies, and public deployment through GitHub Pages.

Project Structure

The repository consists of a main index.html file, supporting asset files such as images and resume documents, and styling managed primarily through the Tailwind CSS CDN. The structure is organized to allow easy scalability and future enhancements.

Deployment

The portfolio is deployed using GitHub Pages. Any updates pushed to the main branch are automatically reflected on the live website.

Future Enhancements

Planned improvements include adding advanced JavaScript interactions, linking live project demos, migrating to a framework-based architecture, integrating backend services for forms, and optimizing performance and SEO.
